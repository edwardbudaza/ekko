# Development Challenges and Solutions

## Technical Challenges

### 1. Hierarchical Data Structure

**Challenge**: Implementing an efficient hierarchical structure for organizations that allows quick traversal and querying.

**Solution**:

- Implemented closure table pattern using TypeORM's tree entities
- Optimized ancestor/descendant queries
- Added caching for frequently accessed structures

### 2. TypeScript Module Resolution

**Challenge**: TypeScript not recognizing module declarations and showing import errors.

**Solution**:

- Updated tsconfig.json with proper include/exclude paths
- Implemented proper module structure
- Fixed circular dependencies
- Added proper type declarations

### 3. Docker Configuration

**Challenge**: Port conflicts and container communication issues.

**Solution**:

- Implemented configurable ports through environment variables
- Added health checks for dependencies
- Configured proper networking between services
- Added volume persistence

### 4. Role-Based Access Control

**Challenge**: Implementing flexible and scalable permission system.

**Solution**:

- Created custom decorators for role checking
- Implemented guard-based authorization
- Added structure-based access control
- Cached permission checks for performance

## Performance Challenges

### 1. Database Query Optimization

**Challenge**: Slow queries when fetching user hierarchies.

**Solution**:
